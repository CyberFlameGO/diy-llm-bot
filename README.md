# DIY LLM Bot

This project allows you to compare a generic GPT-3 based chatbot with ChatGPT.

## Project goals

- Nice user experience of writing a question and getting an answer
- Code snippets with syntax highlighting
- Markdown-like formatting

## Project non-goals

- Quantitative evaluation of the model
- Training models

## Future project goals

Once there are more Machine Learning advancements, this project can be used to compare different LLMs and "test drive" different AIs through the same user interface.
